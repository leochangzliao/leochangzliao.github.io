Work Experience
---------------
*   2016.7-2017.7, Assistant engineer of software development, Co.ltd.ChinaNetCenter.
    -   In charge of audio and video development, e.g. decode H264 or H265 Video via MediaCodec by using hardware in Android         platform, decode video via FFMpeg by using software and de-package FLV, render video and synchronize the audio and           video.

Papers
------
*   Learning Objectâ€™s Scale with Clicks for Object Detection.
    -    Propose a simple yet effective framework which combines CNN visualization and center clicks to generate more tight            pseudo bounding box used for training a fully-supervised object detector. Note that our method can also be used to            annotate instance-level bounding box or pixel-level annotation used for semantic segmentation.
    -    Evaluations on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 show that our method surpasses all state-of-art weakly-supervised detection          methods and center click based methods by a significant margin.
    -    Aimming for ICCV2019.
